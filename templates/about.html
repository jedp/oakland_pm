	<h4>About this site</h4>
	<p>Oakland.PM is a versatile, web-based application also accessible via mobile devices that connects Oakland youth to after-school programs and enrichment opportunities.</p>

	<p>Oakland offers many opportunities for after-school enrichment, but there is presently no on-line method for students to discover them according to their interests, their location, or their friendships. Our application will leverage the social media that youth are already using, such as facebook, twitter, and tumblr, to bring current and personalized information to them.</p>


	<p>This site was created as part of the <a href="http://codeforoakland.org">codeforoakland</a> project. The team, led by Jed Parsons, was awarded the ‘Work with Oakland Prize’ by the City of Oakland. Contributors: Jed Parsons Kristi Holohan, Sonja Totten-Harris, Telly Koosis, Joshua Goldenberg, Christopher Yap, Dave Meyer, Aditya Pai, Greg Martin, Raimundo Martinez, Andrew Hao.</p>
